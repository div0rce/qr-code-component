## Overview

I developed simple, clean, and modern QR code component. It uses HTML and CSS to structure and style the page, respectively. The layout is responsive and centered, with a focus on displaying a QR code image and accompanying text to guide users to Frontend Mentor.

## My process

- Main HTML Structure: Created the main structure with a div container holding an image and text sections. I used meaningful id and class attributes for styling purposes.
- Global Styles: Applied a global reset for box-sizing, padding, margin, and added a red outline for debugging.
- Body Styling: Set a background color and used Flexbox to center the main content both horizontally and vertically.
- Container Styling: Styled the main container with a white background, rounded corners, and fixed dimensions.
- Text Styling: Styled the text elements with specific font settings, colors, and alignment.
- Image Styling: Ensured the QR code image had appropriate margins, fixed size, and rounded corners.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - For custom fonts
- [Frontend mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) - Design inspiration and challenges

### What I learned

How to use a flexbox to center a div :

```css
body {
	display: flex;
	justify-content: center;
	align-items: center;
	min-height: 100vh;
	background-color: #d5e1ef;
	margin: 0;
}
```
